# KNN

A basic implementation of the KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) classification algorithm in Perl.

An example of usage is provided into test_main.pl, using the classic Iris dataset to classify flowers.
This dataset is divided in two parts, the first with 100 entrys (~66,6%) used for training and the second with 50 entrys (~33,3%) used for validation.


A description of the algorithm can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm
